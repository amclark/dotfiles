## amclark's dotfiles

This is just a combination of the following repos wrapped with a simple installation script:
* https://github.com/amix/vimrc
* https://github.com/startup-class/dotfiles

In addition to everything that is included in `vimrc`, I have also included the vim-slime plugin.  The install script doesn't necessarily take everything from `startup-class/dotfiles` (I use vim instead of emacs, and don't use screen).

This is mostly intended for my own personal use, but if anyone finds it useful let me know (amclark7@gmail.com).  I would be happy to clean it up and make it a little more usable.
